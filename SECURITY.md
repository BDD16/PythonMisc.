## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the Fortress of Solitude code then
good for you. If you make a Proof of Concept for that vulnerability
then do make a pull request, and I'll happily look into it when
there is time to do so.  OR if you are so inclined propose a 
solution for a fix with code changes.
